# Quiz 2

### Question 1: Method Calls
> In the Ruby expression `a.foo`, which calls method `foo` on receiver `a`, which of the following conditions affects whether the call succeeds?

- [x] `a` responds to the `foo` method.
- [x] `a`'s class, or one of its superclasses or included modules, implements `method_missing` in a way that handles the `foo` method.
- [ ] `a` is an instance of a class, rather than the class itself.
- [ ] `a` has the correct type.

### Question 2: The Send Method
> What is the result of executing the following code? 
```ruby
x = [1, 2, 3]
x.send :[]=, 0, 2
x[0] + x.[](1) + x.send(:[], 2)
```

- [ ] 5
- [ ] 6
- [x] 7
- [ ] a syntax error or other runtime error

### Question 3: Method Logistics
> When the Ruby expression `foo + bar` is evaluated, which statement is ALWAYS true?

- [x] `bar` is passed as an argument to `foo`'s + method.
- [ ] `foo` is passed as an argument to `bar`'s + method.
- [ ] An error will occur because `+` is only defined for strings and numbers.
- [ ] `foo` and `bar` will be converted to numbers (if necessary) and summed.
