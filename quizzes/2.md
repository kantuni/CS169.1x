# Quiz 2

### Question 1: Method Calls
> In the Ruby expression `a.foo`, which calls method `foo` on receiver `a`, which of the following conditions affects whether the call succeeds?

- [x] `a` responds to the `foo` method.
- [x] `a`'s class, or one of its superclasses or included modules, implements `method_missing` in a way that handles the `foo` method.
- [ ] `a` is an instance of a class, rather than the class itself.
- [ ] `a` has the correct type.

### Question 2: The Send Method
> What is the result of executing the following code?

```ruby
x = [1, 2, 3]
x.send :[]=, 0, 2
x[0] + x.[](1) + x.send(:[], 2)
```

- [ ] 5
- [ ] 6
- [x] 7
- [ ] a syntax error or other runtime error

### Question 3: Method Logistics
> When the Ruby expression `foo + bar` is evaluated, which statement is ALWAYS true?

- [x] `bar` is passed as an argument to `foo`'s + method.
- [ ] `foo` is passed as an argument to `bar`'s + method.
- [ ] An error will occur because `+` is only defined for strings and numbers.
- [ ] `foo` and `bar` will be converted to numbers (if necessary) and summed.

### Question 4: Regular Expressions 1
> You are given the following short list of movies exported from an Excel comma-separated values (CSV) file. Each entry is a single string that contains the movie name in double quotes, zero or more spaces, and the movie rating in double quotes. For example, here is a list with three entries:

```ruby
movies = [
  %q{"Aladdin",   "G"},
  %q{"I, Robot", "PG-13"},
  %q{"Star Wars","PG"}
]
```
> Your job is to create a regular expression to help parse this list:

```ruby
movies.each do |movie|
  movie.match(regexp)
  title, rating = $1, $2
end
# => for first entry, title should be Aladdin, rating should be G, WITHOUT the double quotes
```

> You may assume movie titles and ratings never contain double-quote marks. Within a single entry, a variable number of spaces (including 0) may appear between the comma after the title and the opening quote of the rating.
> Which of the following regular expressions will accomplish this? Check all that apply.

- [x] `regexp = /"([^"]+)",\s*"([^"]+)"/`
- [x] `regexp = /"(.*)",\s*"(.*)"/`
- [ ] `regexp = /"(.*)", "(.*)"/`
- [ ] `regexp = /(.*),\s*(.*)/`
